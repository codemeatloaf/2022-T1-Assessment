Probability Game

Multiplayer 
Board game - players move forward by guessing a probability of a dice with a random amount of sides. 
Players can land on a spot that increases the possibility of a higher roll, but they then need to manage between the upgrades and the dice roll as they 
eventually move forward much quicker but it also becomes much harder to guess the probability of landing on a number.
Each number to guess is a randomly generated number between 1 and 500
Game starts off slow because dice is only 6 sided, so its easy to guess. 

Say a generated number is 6, and you have a 6 sided dice. the answer will be one in 6.
Say the generated number is 15 and you have a 6 sided dice, the answer will be 0/6 because it is a 6 sided dice. 

Each round the dice is increased by 50. 

Board is infinite and person who has made it the furthest in the set amount of time is the winnder

List of possible upgrades
- Number of dice rolled goes up number of dice goes down
- Generated number has a higher chance of being rolled on one of the dice

Programming language is C# or Java using unity engine
